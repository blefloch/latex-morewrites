The morewrites LaTeX package should be used when encountering the
`No room for a new \write ` error.  This is done by redefining a
few TeX primitives related to output.

This package uses the `l3kernel` bundle.

This is work in progress, all suggestions/comments/bug reports are
welcome!


The package is extracted by running

    make package

The documentation is produced by running

    make documentation
