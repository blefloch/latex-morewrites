The morewrites package silently hooks into the TeX primitives
responsible for writing to files to lift the restriction on
the number of files open at the same time (16). Load the package
with "\usepackage{morewrites}" as early as possible.

This package uses the l3kernel bundle.

This is work in progress, all suggestions/comments/bug reports are welcome!
